# QC LDPC recovery
This project aims to recover H matrix of a LDPC code without candidate set on a noisy channel        

Below is the paper showing GERCE method:           
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365961141_Blind_recognition_of_sparse_parity-check_matrices_of_low-density_parity-check_codes_in_the_presence_of_noise


It is basically using gauss column elimination (ECO) with permutation and a column sampling               


## Installations
This project is based on python. Below are the packages that needs to be installed:

numpy                     
numba                     
scipy                   
matplotlib

## version history     
2025.09.24 Migrating code for GERCE method from LDPC project since the project got too big                      
2025.09.25 Removed duplicated dual vectors that can be generated by other vector's block shift
